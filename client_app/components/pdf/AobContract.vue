                                    FRAUD:
                                    In most statesthe Property Representative is legally required to pay its deductible. Property
                                    Representative understands that Available Proceeds as defined and calculated herein in this
                                    Agreement include the Representative’s deductible. Property Representative understands
                                    and acknowledges that it may be able to find another contractor less expensive than {{abbreviation}};
                                    however, for purposes of this Agreement any settlements must reflect {{abbreviation}}’s cost. Any
                                    use by the Property Representative of {{abbreviation}}’s accounting, estimates, monetary
                                    calculations, or the like for its own personal gain or for any and all types of secondary gain
                                    is a misrepresentation of the Property Representative’s true cost to the insurance company
                                    and may constitute fraud. The Property Representative understands that it is illegal to
                                    misrepresent information to an insurance company and that any misrepresentation may
                                    constitute fraudulent activity or other illegal activity. {{abbreviation}} reserves the right to notify all
                                    legal authorities of any misrepresentations, fraudulent activity and/or any other illegal
                                    activity and {{abbreviation}} reserves the right to pursue any and all legal action if necessary.

                                    {{abbreviation}} is not able to guarantee, warrant, assure, state or represent as to the sufficiency of
                                    the amount of the Property Representative’s insurance coverage and whether such
                                    insurance coverage is or will be sufficient to cover the amount due to {{abbreviation}} for all
                                    mitigation, services, repair, restoration and renovation work needed and/or performed. The

                                    insurance company and the Property Representative. {{abbreviation}} has no control over this
                                    contract and therefore cannot guarantee that any loss or damage is covered by insurance or
                                    that the amount of coverage available will permit needed services. Property Representative
                                    understands and agrees that Property Representative is and will be responsible for payment
                                    of all services performed pursuant to this Agreement and which are not covered either
                                    partially or in full by the insurance coverage.
