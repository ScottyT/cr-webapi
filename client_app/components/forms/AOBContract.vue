                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>GOOD FAITH:
                    It is the responsibility of the Property Representative to act in “good faith”. To the extent
                    that any of the Property Representative’s actions or behaviors are deemed inappropriate
                    {{abbreviation}} reserves its right to the Available Proceeds as defined herein in addition to the
                    assignment of the Property Representative’s insurance claim; said assignment already
                    being provided for herein in this Assignment. Property Representative agrees that Code
                    Red Analytics Incorporated retains the right to document, scope and independently account
                    on its own and/or alongside the insurance company concerning the replacement cost and/or

                    the Subject Property.</p>
                  <p>As used herein “Available Proceeds” is defined as the maximum potential amount of
                    funds Code Red Analytics Incorporated (a third party claims management
                    corporation/company) estimates to be the replacement cost value performing the

                    depending on the skills and thoroughness of the adjustor, analyst and {{abbreviation}}. The goal is
                    to make {{abbreviation}} whole.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  FRAUD:
                  In most statesthe Property Representative is legally required to pay its deductible. Property
                  Representative understands that Available Proceeds as defined and calculated herein in this
                  Agreement include the Representative’s deductible. Property Representative understands
                  and acknowledges that it may be able to find another contractor less expensive than {{abbreviation}};
                  however, for purposes of this Agreement any settlements must reflect {{abbreviation}}’s cost. Any
                  use by the Property Representative of {{abbreviation}}’s accounting, estimates, monetary
                  calculations, or the like for its own personal gain or for any and all types of secondary gain
                  is a misrepresentation of the Property Representative’s true cost to the insurance company
                  and may constitute fraud. The Property Representative understands that it is illegal to
                  misrepresent information to an insurance company and that any misrepresentation may
                  constitute fraudulent activity or other illegal activity. {{abbreviation}} reserves the right to notify all
                  legal authorities of any misrepresentations, fraudulent activity and/or any other illegal
                  activity and {{abbreviation}} reserves the right to pursue any and all legal action if necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  NO GUARANTEE OF COVERAGE:
                  {{abbreviation}} is not able to guarantee, warrant, assure, state or represent as to the sufficiency of
                  the amount of the Property Representative’s insurance coverage and whether such
                  insurance coverage is or will be sufficient to cover the amount due to {{abbreviation}} for all
                  mitigation, services, repair, restoration and renovation work needed and/or performed. The
                  amounts and types of coverage are determined under the contract that exists between the
                  insurance company and the Property Representative. {{abbreviation}} has no control over this
                  contract and therefore cannot guarantee that any loss or damage is covered by insurance or
                  that the amount of coverage available will permit needed services. Property Representative
                  understands and agrees that Property Representative is and will be responsible for payment
                  of all services performed pursuant to this Agreement and which are not covered either
                  partially or in full by the insurance coverage.

                  The Property Representative understands this Agreement is not to repair, renovate or
                  rebuild any property. The Property Representative understands {{abbreviation}} is not responsible for
                  and/or liable for prior conditions or damages resulting therefrom including but not limited
                  to mold, asbestos, lead, pollutants, hazardous materials and structural damage before,
                  during or after authorization of this Agreement and/or any conditions or damages caused

                  AGREED LIQUIDATED AND ASCERTAINED DAMAGES:
                  If this Agreement is cancelled or breached by the Property Representative more than
                  twenty-four (24) hours after the execution of this Agreement, then {{abbreviation}} is entitled to
                  payment for the entire scope of its services. {{abbreviation}}’s services include company expertise,
                  research, inventory, investigation, calculations, software, and other services necessary to
                  obtain accurate estimates and provide all said services. The value of these services is not
                  separately invoiced and is beyond simple estimation. The parties agree that the provision
                  of these services entitles {{abbreviation}} to compensation of an amount not yet known but for
                  simplicity and to resolve uncertainty the parties further agree to liquidated damages in the
                  amount of $30.00 per square foot as defined above. Furthermore, the parties understand
